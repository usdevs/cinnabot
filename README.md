## Setting up the environment :earth_asia:

### 0. Install essential packages

We will first need to install git and golang. First install git using your favourite
package manager:

#### Ubuntu/Debian derivatives using APT
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

#### MacOS using Homebrew :beer:
```bash
brew install git
```

Then, install Golang by [downloading from the official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

For Linux systems, you can follow the steps below after downloading:

```bash
cd Downloads # or wherever you downloaded the file
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.12.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# change the lines below to the shell you are using
echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

To verify that Golang is installed properly:
```bash
$ which go
/usr/local/go/bin/go
$ go version
go version go1.12.7 linux/amd64 # version, operating system/architecture
```

### 1. Set the environment variables

All your Go projects should go under a folder called `GOPATH`. We first have to tell your machine 
where that is, by setting up this path in your environment variables. 

Follow the official guide [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH).

For Linux and MacOS users, follow the section under *UNIX Systems*. If you are not sure which shell you are using, enter `$0` into your command line.

You can also follow the steps below:
#### Bash (if you are not sure, you are most likely using BASH)
```bash
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Zsh
```bash
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

At this stage, you can verify that Golang and `GOPATH` are set up properly by:
```bash
$ echo $GOPATH
/home/your_username/go # default GOPATH
```

### 2. Create your Go workspace

Run this command to download the cinnabot project and its dependencies. 
```
go get -u -t -v github.com/usdevs/cinnabot
```
Voila! Now we have cinnabot on our machine. Ready to go!! :tada:


## Testing Cinnabot locally
Overview:
1. [Register for an API Token with `BotFather`](#1-register-for-an-api-token-with-botfather)
2. [Running a test bot on Telegram](#2-running-a-test-bot-on-telegram)

**All instructions below assume you are at the cinnabot root path, unless stated otherwise.**
```bash
$ pwd
/path/to/gopath/src/github.com/usdevs/cinnabot
```

### 1. Register for an API Token with Botfather
Ask for the blessings of the Botfather [here](https://t.me/botfather), as you register for one of the bots.
You will be provided, with honor, an API token where you should put into `main/config.json`.

In other words, click on the link and choose a Telegram handle for your bot, which ends with `...bot` and is not taken yet. Once you are done, you will be provided with the API Token.

Then, we create our `config.json` file using the example file `config.json.example`, and replacing the dummy API Token with the one we just registered.
```bash
cd main
cp config.json.example config.json
```

Fire up your favourite text editor and replace the dummy string in `config.json` with your API Token as a string.

### 2. Running a test bot on Telegram
```bash
cd main
go run main.go
```

And start testing! Fire up your favourite Telegram client, and find the bot by the name you registered it with. You can now test all cinnabot functionalities on your testbot.

When you are done, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> on your terminal to end testing.
